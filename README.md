This is the code used to perform our analysis for the DSC 291 Data Analysis in Physics final project. The `data` directory contains the four `.csv` files provided for our analysis, and all figures and results from our final presentation and paper can be reproduced by running the `analysis.ipynb` Jupyter notebook. Note that due to the inherent randomness in Markov Chain Monte Carlo, there may be some variations across separate fits, although all fit results should be quite similar.
